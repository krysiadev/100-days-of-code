# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed JavaScript Basics on Treehouse; started CSS Layout Basics. In JS Basics: made a quiz that kept track of user's score with variables, then assigned a gold, silver, bronze, or no crown based on the final score using conditionals. Learned about functions and wrote some functions to generate random numbers. In CSS Layout: started a basic website with a centered single-column layout and full width header/footer. Learned how to apply normalize.css; use margin: 0 auto to center content wrappers; use content wrappers to manage widths of content.

**Thoughts:** So excited to be done with JS Basics! I kinda want to keep on doing more JS stuff, but it's nice to get back into CSS for a while because I'm more comfortable with it. My goal is to finish CSS Layouts, Responsive Layouts, and Flexbox Layouts tomorrow.

### Day 2: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished display modes & float sections of CSS Layout on Treehouse. Learned how to use inline-block and floats to create layouts. Also learned how to use a clearfix to solve issues with floats.

**Thoughts:** Floats always confused me but now I understand how floated elements are removed from the normal document flow, so their containers collapse because the containers technically don't have any content in them when their content is floated. The "clear" property is still a little confusing to me, so I'm going to research that.
