# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed JavaScript Basics on Treehouse; started CSS Layout Basics. In JS Basics: made a quiz that kept track of user's score with variables, then assigned a gold, silver, bronze, or no crown based on the final score using conditionals. Learned about functions and wrote some functions to generate random numbers. In CSS Layout: started a basic website with a centered single-column layout and full width header/footer. Learned how to apply normalize.css; use margin: 0 auto to center content wrappers; use content wrappers to manage widths of content.

**Thoughts:** So excited to be done with JS Basics! I kinda want to keep on doing more JS stuff, but it's nice to get back into CSS for a while because I'm more comfortable with it. My goal is to finish CSS Layouts, Responsive Layouts, and Flexbox Layouts tomorrow.
