# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed JavaScript Basics on Treehouse; started CSS Layout Basics. In JS Basics: made a quiz that kept track of user's score with variables, then assigned a gold, silver, bronze, or no crown based on the final score using conditionals. Learned about functions and wrote some functions to generate random numbers. In CSS Layout: started a basic website with a centered single-column layout and full width header/footer. Learned how to apply normalize.css; use margin: 0 auto to center content wrappers; use content wrappers to manage widths of content.

**Thoughts:** So excited to be done with JS Basics! I kinda want to keep on doing more JS stuff, but it's nice to get back into CSS for a while because I'm more comfortable with it. My goal is to finish CSS Layouts, Responsive Layouts, and Flexbox Layouts tomorrow.

### Day 1: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished display modes & float sections of CSS Layout on Treehouse. Learned how to use inline-block and floats to create layouts. Also learned how to use a clearfix to solve issues with floats.

**Thoughts:** Floats always confused me but now I understand how floated elements are removed from the normal document flow, so their containers collapse because the containers technically don't have any content in them when their content is floated. The "clear" property is still a little confusing to me, so I'm going to research that.

### Day 2: May 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS Layout Basics and Responsive Design. 

**Thoughts:** I think it's time to make some kind of really basic webpage completely from scratch so I can make sure I've mastered the different layout techniques before doing the standalone Flexbox course. I've used Flexbox before, but I haven't had a solid foundation on CSS layouts so it'll be good to get everything the 'right' way.

### Day 3: May 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intro to Git.

**Thoughts:** The last time I learned git I didn't really use it much, so hopefully it sticks this time. I've been super tired but I'm still trying to get in at least 20-30 steps on Treehouse each day. I tried to code a small layout project from scratch and kinda came up braindead. I'm going to try again tomorrow. The hardest part is coming up with fake content to make a fake webpage, honestly.

### Day 4: May 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: learned CSS flexbox! 

**Thoughts:** Made a baby flexbox project with a responsive webpage with 2 breakpoints (so a mobile view, small screen/tablet view, and desktop view), which was awesome. I started logging my progress on Twitter today also. It's a little easier, but I also forgot to come update this log, so I'm doing it in bulk for a few days at a time.

### Day 5: May 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: finished HTML Forms course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** This wasn't necessarily the hardest concept to learn, but it was definitely a lot of new information that I had no prior knowledge to build off of. Slowly but surely getting closer to being able to design an interactive web page!

### Day 6: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: back to JavaScript for loops! I learned while, do while, and for loops and did a bunch of cool stuff with them. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first foray into more complex JavaScript -- in previous courses/learning attempts I'd only really gotten through variables and basic mathematical operations. So a little bit uncharted territory for me. But it was really satisfying to build some more complex logic and see it actually work!

### Day 7: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about arrays and objects, and started combining loops with them! I created my most complicated program to date: a quiz that used a two-dimensional array to keep track of questions and answers, then print the user's score and the actual questions they got right & wrong. I also wrote a function that takes 2 arrays - one for suits and one for ranks - and creates a 2 dimensional array of cards that form a deck!

**Thoughts:** WHEW this was a big day. Arrays are simple enough, but getting into 2 dimensional arrays started to give me some trouble - mostly with remembering how to access the different parts of the array in functions, etc. Objects likewise started to get a bit confusing when there were more layers - an object that is an array of other objects was....a lot. I know arrays and objects are key to using JS to do useful things, so I'm trying to really get my head on straight before I move on.

### Day 8: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Did some more object/array practice. And it's DOM manipulation time! I learned how to use JS to select and manipulate parts of a webpage, and make the browser listen for certain events. I learned about using let and const to create variables, and I learned about ES6's arrow syntax.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling under the weather today so I'm not going too crazy with practice. I had been wondering about const and let after seeing them around a few times, so it's good to know what they are and how to use them.
